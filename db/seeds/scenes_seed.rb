	You've just arrived at WTAMU an found that you could use a few 
things to spice up your new dorm room.  Quite by accident you 
happen across an antique furniture store.  Behind the counter is a 
rather unhappy looking gentleman.  Upon seeing you his demeanor 
brightens.  'Excellent!  A customer, finally!  I haven't had a 
single customer since I hired this code monkey here!'.  Following 
the shopowner's gesture, you see a rather disgruntled looking 
chimpanzee sitting in the back typing away at what appears to be 
an unplugged computer.  'I hired him to spruce up the sign outside 
but he's rather bungled up the capitalization and I'm afraid it 
isn't as easy to read as it should be when people drive by.  By 
chance would you happen to know a bit of programming?  I sure could 
use the help.

	"Excellent!  It looks fantastic!  Unfortunately, due to the lack 
of customers and the cost to get this chimp flea dipped, I can't 
really afford to pay you.  What I can do is give you this old chest 
that I'm quite tired of dealing with."  As you start to tell the 
shop owner that you don't need a chest, he shrugs you off and continues 
"Of course every young college student needs a chest, a sea chest at 
that!  Why think of all the rum it must be able to hold!  Now, if 
you don't have any money to spend, I must ask you to leave with that 
rather unsightly chest you've brought in as I am not buying anything 
at the moment, and take that monkey with you!"\n
	Arriving back 
at your dorm with a new old sea chest and an ape in tow, you try 
to open it (the chest, not the chimp!).  Drat, it's locked!  You 
look to the chimp  in hopes he might know something about the 
chest.  He's not even paying attention, instead he's making a rather 
rude gesture to himself in the mirror.  Double drat, the chimp's an 
idiot!  It's up to you to get this chest open.  You notice some 
scribbles above what seems to be a combination lock.  Perhaps a 
little code fu may be in order.

"Success!  As the lid opens, you receive a rather strong slap on 
the back by your new roommate, the chimp with no name.  That 
stung rather fiercely, but luckily enough the impact has caused 
you to lurch far enough into the chest giving you a new angle 
in which to view the inside of the chest.  You spot a rather 
curious seam, and upon a bit of force and a screwdriver, you 
manage to pry it open.  Inside you find an odd assortment of 
items including some old letters, a 5 1/4\" floppy disk, a 
rubber mallet, and an old oil cloth.  The chimp immediately 
grabs the mallet and hits you upside the head with it!  Ouch!  
The chimp smiles back at you as you give him you best, most 
menacing stare.  Realizing there's no way you're going to 
beat a chimp one on one, you return to giving the chest's 
contents your undivided attention.  Upon closer inspection, you 
unravel the oilcloth and notice that the markings on in could  
only be some sort of treasure map!  Who's chest was this, where 
could this map lead, and does anyone have a floppy drive in 
their computer anymore?  Looking at the letters, you notice one 
that states 'In case of my untimely demise, seek out...'  It 
seems to end in a bunch of gibberish.  You feel a tap on your 
shoulder.  As you turn around, you see Chimp Eastwood handing 
you two items: your laptop and the mallet.  Maybe he's not so 
stupid after all.  You realize that the gibberish may just be 
some sort of code, and with a bit of programming wizardry, 
you might just be able to crack it!

Upon arriviing at the university, a secretary is nice enough to show you to
Monty's office.  He's not in, but she tells you he should be finished with
his class soon, and that you can wait inside.  You seat yourself, and looking
around he can tell that Monty is quite eccentric.  He has a stuff rabbit
with fangs, a case that reads "Holy Hand Grenade", a picture of himself followed
by the words "... and the Meaning of Life", and what seems to be a dead parrot.

"And now for something completely different! Some monkey is in my office, and
he's brought his chimp with him!"  Monty seems to have snuck up on you, and is
not pleased to find you in his office it seems.  Afraid he may kick you out, you
rather rapidly tell him what brought you to his office.

"A map you say?  From a chest?  With floppy disks?  The former two interest me 
but that last one sounds like a personal problem!  May I see the map?"  You 
lay the map on his desk, and he leans forward to examine it more closely.  
"You were right to bring this to me, though I'm unsure who would have left
that note, but I am perhaps the most reknowned programmer of Python the 
world has ever seen!"  

He sits a few more minutes in silence studying the map.  Looking up, he seems
somewhat perpelexed.  "Well, this is rather embarrassing, but I don't have a 
clue other than I can tell we'll need a boat.  A boat of which you'll need to
provide, provided of course that you can figure out this bit here..." as he
points to an area on the map that seems to be possibly gibberish.  "If you
can solve this bit, then we may have quite the adventure ahead of us!  But 
first things first, solve this, and then get us a boat!"

Arriving at the docks, you begin your search for a ship to take you on your
voyage.  Unfortunately none of the ships that are for hire suit your needs,
or the crews just plain scare you off.  How did that Gilligan fellow even
become a first mate being that much of a clutz, and was that a patched
hold in their ship?  And the Love Boat?  That's NOT what you need for this
trip, but maybe for Spring Break.  

After a long day of unsuccessful searching, you find yourself in a small,
smoke-filled restaurant.  Upon sitting at a small table to the side, the
owner comes over to your table.  "Let me introduce myself to ye mate, I 
be Long John Slither.  I hear ye be looking for a ship.  I've got an old
ship that should suit ye, and I can even find a crew for it if ye be 
interested.  Ye'd even be getting me as your chef, and not a finer fish
fryer will ye find on these docks if I do say so myself!  And best still
if ye can help me out with a small problem I be having here, you'll have your
ship free of charge!"

A few days later you and your crew have set sail and are now out on the open sea.
"Who hired that snake for a cook?"  Monty's rhetorical question heralds his
arrival at the door to your quarters.  Letting him in, he continues "Do you know
what that reptile cooked for lunch?  His own shedding and he has the nerve to 
call it stew!  What's for dinner, roach chili?  We best find this island of 
yours soon before we die from starvation or food poisoning!"  

As you both sit down at the nearby table, you bring a lamp closer to better
illuminate the map laying across it.  "Well, we've followed the easy clues
on the map, but looks like the last one is a bit tricky.  You'd best break
out that laptop of yours and get to work!"

"Land!  Thank God and his son Brian! Hopefully there's food here that's 
not snake swill or rat meat!" As Monty is about to leap over the edge of 
the boat to run to find something edible on the island, he's met with a 
sword at his throat!

"What do ye mean calling me cooking swill?  And rats be my delicacy! If 
me and me mates weren't about to turn on ye anyway, that insult would have
sealed your fate!"  Pyrates!  Long John Slither and his crew are pyrates!

"Take 'em below deck and lock 'em in the hold!  We may have need of 'em later!"
One of his crew takes the map from you as they lead you, Monty, and the chimp
down to the hold and lock you inside.  

"Well this is a fine mess you've gotten us into!  How do you expect to get us
out of here without getting us killed?"  Monty is right, you've got to get out
somehow!  Looking around the hold, you search for something.  Well, the chimp found a crate of bananas, and it looks like Monty's empty stomach is 
provoking him to fight the monkey for those bananas.  This could get ugly fast!
You examine the locked door a bit closer, and it seems there's a puzzle of sorts
that might hold the key to unlocking it.  Time to see if you can crack it!

"... and that's for cooking my hat!"  Seemingly satisified with the pyrates'
	fate, Monty catches up to you.  Luckily enough, it seems Slither and his crew
	made some notes on the map that have assisted you in finding something quite 
	odd.

	You find yourselves standing in a cave with a skeleton, a bunch of electric
	cables, and an old power generator.  You try the generator, and it seems to still have some power left in it.  A whirring of unseen machines begins to 
	reverberate throughthe cave, however, you don't see any kind of useable device
	aside from the generator as the cables disappear into the walls.  Upon closer inspection, you find a floppy disk drive inside the skeleton's mouth.  "Well
	it's a good thing you brought those with you from several scenes back isn't it?" Monty is right, it is a good thing you kept those!  Inserting one into the 
	skeleton's maw, you hear a sound, and can make out a very faint glow from one
	of the walls.  As you sweep your hand across the wall, you find a monitor that
	was inbedded there all along, just covered in inches of dust.  On the monitor
	is what is hopefully the last puzzle of this trip
