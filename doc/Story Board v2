Story Board v 2.0

Scene 1:
	Script: You've just arrived at WTAMU, and found that you could use a few things 
	to spice
	up your dorm.  You happen across, quite by accident, an antique furniture store.
	Behind the counter is a rather unhappy looking gentleman with a powdered wig.
	Upon seeing you his demeanor brights.  "Excellent, a customer, finally!  I 
	haven't had a single customer since I hired this code monkey here!  The name 
	on the sign is correct, but he's rather bungled up the capitization, and I'm 
	afraid it isn't as easy to read as it should be when people drive by it. 
	Mayhap you know a bit of coding?  I could sure use the help."

	Description: An antique shop with a old English figure in a powdered wig, with a 
	monkey in the background typing on an old computer.  

Scene 2:
	Script:  "Excellent! It looks fantastic! Unfortunately, due to the lack of 
	customers, and the cost it took to get this chimp flea dipped, I can't afford to 
	pay you. But what I can do is give you this old chest"  As you start to tell the 
	shopowner you don't need a chest, he ignores you and continues "Of course every 
	young college student needs a chest, a sea chest at that!  Why think of all the 
	rum it must be able to hold!  Now, if you don't have any money to spend, I must 
	ask you to leave with this rather unsightly sea chest you've brought in as I 
	have no need of it, and take that pesky monkey with you!"  Arriving back at your 
	dorm with a new old sea chest and a monkey in tow, you try to open it(the chest, 
	not the monkey!).  Drat! It's locked!  You look at the monkey, maybe he knows 
	something about the chest.  You look up in time to see the monkey make a rather
	rude gesture to himself in the mirror.  Double drat!! The monkey is an idiot. 
	It's up to just you to get this chest open....

Scene 3:
	Script:  Success!  As the lid opens, you recieve a rather strong slap on the back
	by your new roommate, the chimp.  That hurt!  But the impact caused you to lurch 
	forward, and has given you a new angle to view the inside of the chest.  You 
	spot a rather curious crease, and upon a bit of force and a screw driver, you 
	manage to pry it open.  Inside you find some rather odd items:  some 5 1/4 inch 
	floppy disks, a rubber mallet, some old letters, and an old oil cloth.  The chimp
	immediately grabs the mallet and hits you upside the head with it!  This monkey
	is going to be the death of you!  Upon a closer examination of the oil cloth, 
	you find markings that could only be a treasure map of some sort!  Who's chest
	was this, where could this map lead, and does anyone even have a floppy drive
	on their computers anymore?  Looking at the letters, you notice one says "In 
	case of my untimely demise, seek out ..."  Hmm, it's a bunch of numbers.  It must
	be some kind of code!  You feel a tap on your shoulder.  As you turn around, the monkey holds out two items, a keyboard, and the mallet.  Maybe he's not so 
	stupid!  You grab your keyboard and get to work trying to crack this code....

Scene 4:
	Montana Jones?  Who is Montana Jones?  And wasn't the dog's name Montana?
