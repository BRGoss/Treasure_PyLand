DESCRIPTION:  Check if a string's character are in the 
              same order in another string
ALGORITHM:    Iterate over the big string, checking for
              the letter you are currently on in the 
              sample string. When you find a match,
              increment index for the sample string.
              Iterate over the long string until you
              find a matching character for all the 
              characters in the sample string, or 
              until you run out of characters to 
              check in the long string.
Example: Input = 'A long long time ago this was a better time, at least for me' 
         Output = 'A long long time ago this was'

def same_order(s):
	isTrue=0
	compString='NAGARRO'
	i=0
	j=0
	while (isTrue==0 and i<len(s)):
		if(compString[j]==s[i]):
			j+=1
		if(j==len(compString)):
			isTrue=1
		i+=1
	if(isTrue==1):
		print 'True'
	else:
		print 'False'
	return
