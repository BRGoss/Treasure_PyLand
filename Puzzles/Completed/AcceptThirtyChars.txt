         Output = 'A long long time ago this was'

def accept_thirty(sentence):
	words=string.split(sentence,' ')
	theString=''
	count=0
	i=0
	while (count < 30):
		count=count+len(words[i])+1
		if (count <= 30):
			theString=theString+words[i]
			if((count+len(words[i+1])+1) <= 30):
				theString=theString+' '
		i=i+1
	print theString
